# VOTV-Secrets-Website
VOTV Secrets Website is dedicated to archiving all of the secrets, spoilers, and easter eggs in VOTV game developed by MrDrNose. This website includes multiple webpages and sections that detail each part very extensively. This website also aims to keep all information as updated and accurate as possible, as VOTV is still in beta/alpha so it isn't fully released yet.

## Note
It is highly recommended that before browsing on this site, actually go play the game of VOTV first. Just so that none of the content or info you see on the site will ruin the game experience for you. But the choice is up to you and yours only, I'm not responsible for ruining anyone's experiences in VOTV.
