  <h1>Other Worlds</h1>
  <h2>Description:</h2>

    Within the game files are several worlds that don't classify as either an anomaly or as a test

    The old tutorial. All assets are intact, and it can be played through until the end. The player
    was originally going to learn about vehicles and the power block, but those assets have been
    moved out of bounds. It ended by the player typing "cake" into the console, which would then
    produce red text saying "is a lie" and then booting the player to the menu.

    Was the tutorial for the main game, features the tutorial on interacting with objects and items,
    as well as moving around, using the Playback, Denoising, Coordinate, and Filtering terminal,
    using the command console and repairing servers, and how to send processed drives. Although one
    strange feature is the Jellyfish that randomly fly around the map and phase through, this is a

      In the room with the gas cans and beers if you were to access on the top platform either by

      In the room with the all the terminals tutorials there is a little keyhole behind one of the
      pillars, there is nothing you can do with this keyhole currently as there is a white cube
      obstructing its insides. However also in the same chamber there used to be a vent located on
      the top, to break it you would throw objects at it for a while until it crumbles. If you were
      to manage to climb inside you will find a popup. But this has been blocked off. There is also
      a radioactive capsule on top of the blue slide, you just throw some items to knock it off. And
      in one of the white blocks of light (as marked by the donut tube), you can go walk through and
      after navigating around the white void, you can find a white door.

      You first spawn at the top of a hole and fall into another underwater pipeline maze. Once out,
      you will be faced with a dark maze that you'll need to navigate through.

    <p id="32">
      There are two maze solutions, the main one is: left, right, right, left, left, straight,
      right, straight, right, left, right, straight, left, right, right, left, right, left,
      straight, left, left, right, right, left, right, left, right, left, with each turn you move
      foward and each straight you pass one line of corridors.
    </p>

    <p id="33">
      To access the second but not main solution to the maze you must go from the main maze
      solution, turn around and go: right, left, left, straight, right, straight, left, straight,
      right, left, straight, straight, left. Once you have found the entrance you will be greeted
      with a ghetto like area with a tree in the middle.

    <p id="34">
      Once at the end of the main maze solution, you will enter into a dark arched chamber with a
      ladder at one side.
    </p>

    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/OtherWorlds/150.png" />

    <p id="35">
      Once having climbed the ladder, you will encounter a super large chamber with pipes and
      pillars running through all over the place. There is a second level in which to access you
      must parkour your way up the pipes and climb. But also in this room you can go through one of
      the white lights as marked by the workbench I placed here, from there you keep walking until
      you fall into a hole of water and a door at the end.

    <p id="36">
      When you have reached the second level, you will encounter a double chamber with little
      swimming pools and an unreachable ladder. To reach this ladder, you hit the button behind one
      of the pillars. There is also a breakable wall that leads to a vent. That vent eventually
      leads to a room with a pile of blood, a podium with a star and a plush which is a reference to
      a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JollyWangcore">youtuber, Jolly Wangcore</a> who spent hours
      in the tutorial instead of the main game.

    <p id="37">
      After climbing two sets of ladders and ledges you will encounter another poolroom that has
      slanted arches and a pool on one side. Climbing on the very end ledge you will fall down a
      hole.

    <p id="38">
      The hole will lead you into a circular chamber with 7 levels, on the second level there is a
      corridor.

      Once through you will find the first jail cell with bars that you can pull apart and walk onto
      a ledge.

      From there you can break through some vents to get access to the second jail cell.

    <p id="41">
      Eventually you'll make your way over another super large chamber but with deep pools of water,
      with tons of doorways on one side.

      Going to the one that is on the same level as the player and 3 doorways ahead of you will have
      a vent that when went through, will lead you to the final level.
