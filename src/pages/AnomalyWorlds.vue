  <h1>Anomaly Worlds</h1>
  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    Hidden within the game files of VOTV, are some anomaly worlds that are either very strange,
    unique, have multiple levels, or are extremely random. Some of these worlds cannot be accessed
    in any normal gameplay mechanic and will require cracking the game, while some can be accessed
    through specific means.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of these levels will include parts of the different test levels and some random ones that
    you can find and load up.

    A platformer minigame level, the player's camera is faced towards a 2d platformer game. The
    player's model and character is transformed into the 2d humanoid. There are no rules, endings,
    or goals. There are two enemies, a couple obstacles, and an infinite void. The player can jump
    and move around. Not much else to note about this world.

  <p id="5">
    A large map that consists of multiple rooms, hallways, and corridors. This level is very simliar
    and corresponds with that of the Backrooms Poolrooms or backrooms level 37.
  </p>
  <SpoilerBlock>
    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/5.png" />

    <p>
      When you first spawn you are brought into a room that consists of a mannequin and some items.
    </p>

    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/6.png" />

    <p>
      When you walk in to the next room there are two exits, one is a hole that leads to a giant
      cavern of water below, and the other exit leads to a large cooridor or hallway.
    </p>

    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/7.png" />

    <p>
      Inside the large water filled cavern, is a hole at the bottom where you can swim through to
      reach an another room.
    </p>

    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/8.png" />
    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/9.png" />

    <p>
      Inside this room, consists of large steps that cannot be jumped over that head down in a large
      tall room. It has two entrances one is through the small hole from the water chamber and the
      other is from a ladder that you climb down from another hole. At the bottom of the giant
      staircase is a sewer like hole that heads in the back direction that only extends just a
      little and an entrance to another large room is also present.
    </p>

    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/10.png" />
    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/11.png" />
    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/12.png" />

    <p>
      Once you've reached to the bottom of the staircase entered through entrance, you will be
      greeted with yet another large tall room but in this one there is a small pool of water and it
      also includes a small wall filled with circle cutouts.
    </p>

    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/13.png" />

    <p>
      This corridor that is the other exit from the 2nd room is filled with objects of different
      shapes, in one end of the hallway is a staircase that blocks or presents as a wall and in the
      other end is an spiraled hole that leads to a waterlogged room.

    <p>
      Another POI that is located in large corridor is the entity,
      <a href="../Entities/entitieswiki.html#spiderarg">Spider Argemia</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="../Entities/entitieswiki.html#spiderarg">Spider Argemia</a>
      is located in the very back of the large corridor. The
      <a href="../Entities/entitieswiki.html#spiderarg">Spider Argemia</a>
      is only hostile to the player once, after it lunges, chases and presumably attacks the player
      once, it will leave the player alone.
    </p>

    <ImageViewer alt="VOTV Archive Image" src="/Images/Worlds/AnomalyWorlds/17.png" />

    <p>
      Inside the waterlogged room is a hole that once you crawl through will lead to another large
      tall room with a giant staircase. To climb down you can use the ladder that is present there.

    This level appears to be the backrooms level 6 or the lights out level. Once there, it is very
    dark and has a maze like structure that the player spawns in. After some time the backrooms will
    auto-generate more mazes hence making it infinite. The backrooms also spawns you with a free but
    fuel-empty lantern. But after a short while the game may crash due to lag. The

      You will be spawned into a pool of red liquid, large chamber filled with holes, red Ariral

      The outside of the chamber has giant spikes potruding outwards a limited distance. Another
